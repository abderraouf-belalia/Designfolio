# Design, Beauty and Aesthetics
Note: Author’s notes will be written in ‘italic’.

“It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” — Antoine de Saint-Exupery

It is clear that, one can always find something to add. Integration is endless. One can always extend the a given situation to a broader context. Yet cutting out things has a threshold beyond which the subject loses purpose.

“On the one hand, beauty is not just ornamental or contemplative. On the other, beautiful objects do not necessarily have an immediate practical use. So, what function, if any, will attractive design serve? In this book, we will argue it can help users and designers to deal with complexity.”

Seems to be an interesting north amid chaos.

Digital technologies make it easier than ever to embed more information and intelligence into products and services. […] While digital technologies empower our experience in many ways, this empowerment comes with a price: information overload.

Complexity arises from having too much to process and no organizing principle to navigate with. In matters of UX, such principle must be embedded in design.

The vast amount of information we are bombarded with, or actively look for, makes us more informed and knowledgeable – and more aware of what we do not know. This awareness makes the world appear complex and makes us anxious. Because simple and useful design is tough to create, average designers react by overshooting complexity and stuffing our devices (and our personal lives) with more features, layers, functionalities, structures and gears.

Survival requires the mastering of two
antithetic basic instincts (Berghman and Hellert 2017). On the one hand, we want to minimize the risks deriving from exposure to novel, unknown situations. On the other, we are excited to discover new opportunities that may be accessible if we engage in risky exploration. This dual thinking is ubiquitous in our decisions […]

[…] aesthetics is a fundamental driver behind most human choices.

Aesthetic reasoning involves filtering information and making decisions through these types of aesthetic criteria.

What criteria? Projection of things will look, anticipated principles along with the generated order and how well we appreciate  it.

Aesthetic reasoning works pretty well because aesthetic judgment contains useful knowledge that has been accumulated and validated through evolution (reproduction and survival), culture (is it socially desirable?) and personal experience (did it work in the past?).

[…] aesthetic decision-making is a skill. To acquire a new skill, we need two tools: first, a method and, second, one or more metrics – the evaluation criteria to assess whether we are doing well.

1. The method consists of the mastery of eight design heuristics, a set of principles for the organization of visual information.

2. The metric measures how efficiently a design helps users absorb new information (effective complexity).

Method

The feelings we experience in front of this paintings result from the competition between two critical information processing modes. On the one hand, our search for plausible answers pushes us to look for different angles (search for variety). On the other, our brain tries to match what we see with what we already know (search for unity).


“Art offers a form of playful simulation, so we are more likely to risk innovative interpretations here than we are in reality.”

This book shows that this intuitive dual thinking (search for variety versus search for unity) can be applied more systematically through eight fundamental design heuristics, four supporting each mode. We define these heuristics as compositional strategies because they can help designers achieve given design objectives by arranging design elements in different configurations.

Strategies in the “search for unity”
1. Subtract Details. 
“Artists create some abridged version of reality by reducing an experience’s complexity to a subset of relevant entities.”
2. Develop Symmetry.
“In art as in nature, symmetry allows our cognitive system to generate complex forms more efficiently through hierarchies, focal points, distances, directions and visual weights.”
3. Group
“Cluster similar objects into logical, spatial or narrative categories.”
4. Split
“Organize and navigate complexity across a hierarchy of information layers.”
Strategies in the “search for variety”
1. Use the power of the center.
“Create a dominant visual centre using colours, shapes, lines and visual weights to guide the observer’s understanding of the deep structure of the composition.”
2. Emphasize.
“The goal of this strategy is the deliberate distortion of some detail or significant feature.”
3. Remix.
“Break down and reconnect elements in new, unexpected combinations.”
4. Contrast and balance.
“Create tension and equilibrium among the elements of a composition to stimulate emotions.”

Metric
We mentioned that aesthetic pleasure is related to the perception of order. But what kind of order do we look for? And how much order do we need?

[…] order is acceptable as long as it is not trivial, whereas novelty is welcome as long as we can handle it.

So, how do we measure the ideal mix of familiarity and novelty in an aesthetic arrangement?

This amount to measure the right amount of complexity

effective complexity as the shortest description of the perceived regularities in a system (Gell-Mann and Lloyd 1996)

$$EffectiveComplexity = \frac{Meaning}{Information}$$

How can we interpret this equation?

When the interface is too complicated, users must process too much information to figure out what they can do with that product. If it’s too simple, the product will be easy to use, but quite disappointing in terms of performance.

“What we call a simple interface is actually an effectively complex interface.”

Variety and Unity are like acid and base.

[…] our pedagogy in this book will be based on learning how great artists achieve effective complexity.

Achieving effective complexity is essential for the design of tools and interfaces able to facilitate users’ information processing.

[…] makes its complexity available to its users, but it does not force them to face it if they do not want to or do not have the skills to handle it. […] organization across layers also introduces some level of graduality that can help users to explore this additional complexity with small and incremental efforts.

When facing information overlap we look for unity, a cheap trick, an organizational principle, an insight which casts order to on the information inducing compression and thus reducing the load.

“Think of the last time you had to solve a problem and came up with an unsatisfying solution. Think of how you represented the problem and how this representation led you to critical design decisions and an execution plan. Finally, consider the outcome and whether your customers were happy about it. If they were not, it was for either one of the following reasons: 1) the design was too simple to capture the actual complexity of their problem; 2) the design was too complex for their problem. In either case, the complexity of the solution did not match the complexity of the problem. It was the likely result of an inadequate understanding of the problem and/or insufficient experimentation with design alternatives exhibiting different complexity levels.
Think now at what you could have done better. First, did you fail because your solution was too innovative? Or because you underestimated the novelty of the problem and tried to adapt a known solution that ultimately did not work?”

We argue that there are two fundamentally different but highly complementary design mindsets: designing for information and designing for meaning. Traditionally, design for information refers to packaging information properly to augment aesthetic pleasure and usability, while design for meaning prioritizes sensing what users, like and need at a deeper level; how they make sense of a design; and how they interpret it.

“[…] can we use the ‘grouping’ strategy to build a new narrative about what the design is or does? Does our ‘emphasize’ strategy work in a given cultural context? What kind of storytelling do we enable when we ‘split’ information in a certain way?”
Aesthetics Reasoning

Is there a reason why we love unfinished representations and prefer them to more accurate renderings?

[…] isn’t it a paradox that a picture with less information is perceived as more exciting and perhaps even more informative?

“we see what we know”

We can only perceive what we recognize. Lack of distinction, of understanding, is indeed ignorance.

We see things clustering, connecting, closing, and moving together because our brain builds a story through a cinematic interpretation of the image.

It has been argued, in fact, that one of the functions of art is to provide a safe mental space in which we can play with pattern recognition and refine our ability to observe and map reality into creative alternative representations without taking any chances.

Learning without the pain of learning is probably the secret mix behind aesthetic pleasure. Great art can trigger this sort of reverse-engineered creativity because artists wisely infused some complexity in simple representations people could easily relate to. 

Mediocre artists and designers simplify in the wrong way when they over-apply conformist aesthetic canons and representational conventions that make their artifacts predictably boring.

Simplification and complexification.

Do not hyper-specify your design; let the users do the task of filling the gaps. Less is better; choose a focal element and suggest potential connections.

Spend enough time understanding the “component”. What it means? What it implies? Understanding its constraint — information. Then identify its interaction with other components, what kind of tension does it create? Exploit these tensions to heighten certain aspects of a components.

[…] good design is about good composition. Good composition is the artistic arrangements of information into a coherent whole that is more than the sum of its parts.

Composition is the compound of heightened aspects and features due to the tension between components.

Sense-making: (1) Isolate salient informational features, (2) Compare with pre-existing mental models and (3) Resolve ambiguity by confirming or revising our expectations.

The artist’s objective is to isolate the essential in what she sees, often through prolonged observation of an object and painstaking refinements that lead to an ‘elegant’ representation. 

It is a two-way process, looking for an optimal match between the forms in the brain and the sensory information, between abstraction and perception.

We are, in fact, creative anytime we arrange elements into some aesthetically pleasant configuration.

`TotalInformation = EffectiveComplexity + Noise`

Effective complexity is, then, the ideal amount of information we need to understand the meaning of something.

A design that is too complicated has too much information — positive-noise. One that is too trivial has negative-noise, that is, it misses information that could make it understandable. A great design is a zero-noise solution.

The search for unity relies mainly on eliminating details and reducing noise by subtraction and aggregation.

to search for variety to ‘complexify’ our experience and develop more articulated mental representations. Of course, if we err on the variety side, our interpretations will be too noisy and unnecessarily complex.

Unity versus Variety. Convergent versus Divergent reasoning.

We explore more complex possibilities through divergent reasoning, while convergent reasoning helps us focus on viable solutions.

When do we stop?

When an adequate level of complexity is achieved.

[…] in creative problem-solving, we look for effectively complex representations by trial and error.

A. In the Search for Unity :: Reduce Noise
Strategy I. Subtract Details
The fundamental idea behind this strategy is that artists and designers should suggest rather than describe reality. They can do so by reducing a complex system to a few powerfully expressive elements.

- Subtraction supports fast information processing through information compression. 
- It helps designers to focus on what matters in the situations in which a design will be used. 
- Simple and even incomplete representations are suggestive and liberate users’ imaginations.

“Whatever we see is the result of this construction, an analytical projection of elementary mental shapes. Cezanne’s brush strokes are perceptual quanta, colourful geometric tiles that our brain projects on reality to understand form and volume.”

Achieving beauty by subtraction is effective. The use of simple modules that can be rearranged in many ways makes it easier for the viewer to understand complexity. It also makes our experience pleasurable because it leads to discovering the primary forms that can create order in the world. A caveat, though: Simplification is not about just removing details, but about understanding which simple elements we need to support meaningful and even complex tasks.

One criterion to evaluate the effectiveness of an interface is its full transparency to the user. Great interfaces disappear from the cognitive and sometimes even the user’s visual field because they make it natural to interact with a device. Ghost Interface.

[…] our ability to solve a problem depends on how we frame the problem, and we tend to build minimalistic frames that can accommodate as many as examples as possible.

“Minimalist design can trigger our imagination.”

Appeal to the joy of guessing via abstract representation, in contrast to the joy of  forecasting.

- Semantic efficiency/compression: Subtraction is not just aimed at eliminating irrelevant materials; it also helps in effectively compressing information in a design to increase its expressive power. This design strategy is fundamental to achieving semantic efficiency: communicate the most with minimum information.

Question the necessity of each element. Identify what is impossible to remove. When in doubt, remove it! You can always put it back.

- The power of context: Things exist in a context and their meaning and use change across different contexts. Not all the details of an object are important in each situation: to make an object relevant in a given context, we have to strip or ignore all the details that do not matter (if a chair is used as a ladder, in that context the armrests are not relevant).

Be contextual. Identify essential user needs and map them over essential product features and functions. Repurpose design.

- Simplification is generative; the lack of details favors creative thinking and unconstrained exploration more than the mere recognition of known forms does.

Use emptiness; leave space for thinking and exploring. Assess the evocative power; what does it say beyond the obvious? Preserve agency; do not do what the users can figure out for themselves.

                                                                                                    

Strategy II. Develop Symmetry
Symmetry allows our brain to generate complex shapes in a more efficient way, by using only half a fraction of the information. Symmetry helps to identify hierarchy, focal points, distances and directions.

Symmetry provided a unique ordering principle through which it was possible to read and interpret the world; perhaps in incorrect ways, as the story shows, but ones that can make a lot of sense.

Absolute symmetry results in a white canvas. Symmetries are constraints, the more you have the less you do.

Understanding symmetry requires the ability to abstract our thinking from the immediacy of perception and feelings. Abstracting requires two basic operations: first, to isolate the object from the background; second, to assume a point of view.

To appreciate the symmetry of a scene we have to turn the scene into a unitary object. This can be done by imposing a frame that cuts out the scene from its background (Arnheim 1965). The frame creates invisible medians and diagonals around which elements in the composition acquire visual weights, roles, and meanings as part of a system of perceptive and cognitive tension.

![[Pasted image 20220902113438.png]]

Symmetry helps us build identity from distinct parts. If we trace a plane that cuts the human body vertically into two sides and turn one part over the other, the two parts roughly coincide. This reflection establishes an identity. If we rotate a star by a fifth of a circle, we do not notice any change. Symmetry exists only by virtue of a movement that restores the initial form; its secret is in the way this movement takes us back to identity and unity.

The expected outcomes of movement is change the initial state into a different final state. Yet in symmetric movements, the outcome is the same the initial state. Invariance.

Total symmetry produces absolute uniformity. To appreciate symmetry, the observer should be able to distinguish an entity from the others. Symmetry cannot be total. If it is, it cancels out the experience.

Symmetry breaking mechanisms.

Ernst Gombrich (1979) states that only the breaking of total symmetry gives rise to the perception of patterns. And the mathematicians Golubitsky and Stewart (1992) point out that we begin to appreciate symmetry in physical forms only when total symmetry breaks up into partial symmetries.

“Physics also teaches us that if energy in a system is homogeneously distributed, the system is incapable of performing work. Work is executed and energy is liberated when this uniformity is broken. A steam engine can work only if steam is separated into a hot container and channelled into a colder one. Water falls down from a higher position with higher potential energy. The electric current flows because there is an asymmetry in the electron distribution between the positive pole and the negative pole of a battery.”

Boltzmann called entropy the measure of total uniformity in energy distribution (Atkins 1984).

Symmetry is a principle that we use to give order to reality.

A symmetric world is not static and inert: The tensions created through symmetry can be broken anytime by a minimal perturbation that can put everything in discussion.

Effective complexity is always obtained by a problematic balance of two opposing forces: the search for variety and the pursuit of unity. 

 Identify symmetrical counterparts for functions and parts in your design that you had not initially considered.  There could be more than one symmetry. Identify alternative axes or focal elements. Experiment with a little asymmetry to create visual tension. Play with contrast and use symmetric balance to help contrasting elements coexist. Understand the ‘natural’ order of things in your design context.

                                                                                                    

Strategy III. Group
[…] groups provide order by similarity, vicinity, closure and segregation or by suggesting common destiny. Our brain identifies some common trait or feature shared by different elements to cluster them into a category.

In addition to the obvious objective of allocating the elements of our design into clear categories, the ultimate goal of this strategy is to group elements through different criteria (space, time, and network relationships) to create powerful narratives that help users to connect the dots and quickly understand how they can browse information in our design.

[…] grouping is not just classifying – it’s about creating mental ‘places’ that we arrange in a specific order to build action-oriented narratives.

The power of categorization lies in its dynamic, structuring property and in its ability to influence our actions.

Grouping helps designers to identify fundamental units of meaning, clumps of sense, around which they can re-invent by re-organizing.

The proper arrangements of these units into a cohesive and compelling message will then appear to observers as emerging naturally from the interaction among the various parts.

 George Miller (1956) showed that, on average, individuals could memorize up to seven (plus or minus two) different stimuli at the same time in a variety of tasks, including the ability to recognize musical tones, taste solutions with different salt concentrations, and identify and memorize visual stimuli. Miller referred to this limitation as ‘channel capacity’, borrowing ideas from the then-emerging information theory (Shannon 1948).

If our attention can handle only seven different items at the time, how can we process and manage more complex information? A solution is through hierarchy: Once we recognize familiar connections among different units, we can zip them into a more meaningful and compact representation.

Gestalt laws of grouping, (1) proximity, (2) similarity, (3) closure, (4) continuation, (5) common fate, (6) connectedness.

Cognitive scientists have identified in ‘chunking’ one of the mechanisms our brain uses to group information (Neath et al. 2003). A ‘chunk’ is a collection of elementary units that are stored in memory and recalled together. The typical size of the chunk is – you guessed it – seven, plus or minus two.

Become familiar with conventions: There is no harm in accepting types and labels if they are based on valid and accepted criteria of information organization. Beware of stereotypes and the commonplace: Always question taken-for-granted grouping criteria. Tell people stories they want to hear: Build user-stories that users can understand and that reflect their spontaneous behaviour. Build a story when it’s hard to find one. Connect the dots: Some apparently unrelated behaviours may actually reveal a user’s need. Mind the gap. Disconnection when, spurious or unwanted connections are created by chance and can lead to errors and confusion.

                                                                                                    

Strategy IV. Split
Complex information needs to be displayed at different levels. For instance, contrasting foreground with background helps us to focus on a particular level of the image. Encapsulating details into a larger structure guides the eye from the general to the particular and vice versa […]

[…] we need to deep dive into the complexity of the object or experience we are analyzing; then, we have to re-emerge at a higher, more general level in which we make sense of what we observed.

[…] one fundamental way to deal with complexity is to find effective mechanisms to navigate across these levels.

The fact that we do not notice, on the first inspection, the richness of this information is a sign that the splitting is working very well. Our mind can wander seamlessly between the detail and the higher-level narrative to the point that we are not aware of the lower level, even if we perceive it.

The first step in constructing an effective split is to get lost in contemplating a dull object and observing it as if it were the most novel of the things. This research is often triggered by a gut feeling that we miss something important, just in front of our eyes, that we cannot decipher and articulate. That something is talking to us; it is struggling to emerge to the surface of our conscience.
It takes patience, time and a remarkable ability to listen before we set out to say something. The second step is to determine how we can connect the rich information embedded into critical details with the broader message we intend to convey. Again, it is about splitting information across two or more levels and allowing users to move flawlessly across them.

Splitting is not about defining a top-down hierarchy but about providing a dynamic organization of information at different levels of depth and mechanisms that support smooth navigation across the levels.

The splitting strategy is ubiquitous in nature. Pattern recognition, an ability that the human brain exhibits to a remarkable degree  is about the automatic identification of details and their connection to higher-level concepts.
This holistic nature of pattern recognition and understanding is the result of hierarchical and parallel mechanisms through which our brain processes information. The integration of input coming from parallel processing is a process called binding (Kandel 2016).

Intense focus on an object facilitates the binding process in two steps. Low-level information helps our brains quickly recognize essential features like size, colour and shape of an item in the pre-attentive phase. In the attentive phase, higher-level visual centres in the brain identify specific features and infer that, since several features occupy close or related visual space positions, those features must be bound together.

The unconscious recognition of lower-level details is behind gut feeling decisions.

Identify a hierarchy among the functions: Observe what users do with your product, identify functions, and map functions in a hierarchy. Make the hierarchy visible: Create visual devices that make this hierarchy visible, accessible and easy to operate. Make the hierarchy easy to navigate: Make sure users have easy ways to move across levels and that they won’t get lost. Make your foreground prominent: What are the critical tasks, and which are the essential functions and controls? Are they clearly prominent and visible? Do not hide your background: Something that is in the background still needs to be accessible and visible. Be whole: What is the honest key message your design is communicating? You don’t know? You’d better find it! Connect the whole and the small: Are the details of your design helping users to converge towards the message? Is there anything that is inconsistent or distracting?

B. In the Search for Variety :: Increase Entropy
Strategy I. Use the Power of the Centre
This strategy is about the creation of one or few dominant visual centres by using colours and lines to guide the eye toward particular points […]

Visual centres create lines of force in an image and can be introduced to rebalance a composition through a more effective redistribution of visual weight across an interface. They can also help us to re-structure our design in different ways by rewiring the connections among them to create more expressive configurations.

In art and design, identifying good centres makes the whole system coherent with the message and the performance it intends to convey.

Rudolph Arnheim (1983) provides plenty of examples on how the search of visual centres and their connections in an image drive our interpretation of complex visual stimuli. Even more critical in Arnheim’s theory is the concept of a field of forces that emanate from a visual centre.

To explain the effects of visual centres in perception, Arnheim often refers to the visual weight metaphor. The visual weight of an element in an image does not depend on objective properties such as its colour and shape, but on how our brain processes these features.

Wrong assumptions can lead to catastrophe when associated with powerful centres shaping the behaviour and functionality of all the other essential components of the system.

Users will be naturally drawn towards the centre and, from there, will be able to figure out how the functional logic of the design unfolds.

Focus on the centre, the rest will follow: Build your design around and from centres and the details will follow, driven by the forces emanating from the centres. May the force guide you: Find the lines of forces connecting the centres. Are they easy to identify? Do they connect centres in a way that make sense? Do they help focus or provoke distraction? Point of view is everything: Reconfigure your centres – for instance, by altering the connections of the centres’ hierarchy – and observe how your design changes and how users’ behaviour change. Dangling conversation: One way to look at a story is as a conversation in which the teller answers the listeners’ questions and expectations. What happens next? Why does that happen? Use your centres to make sure the story you tell is aligned with the story they can follow and enjoy.

                                                                                                    

Strategy II. Emphasize
This strategy consists of the deliberate attempt to celebrate diversity or exceptionality […]

[…] a marketing strategy that aims to make a brand/product occupy a distinct position, relative to competing brands, in the mind of the customer.
[…] positioning develops products or brands that stand out among the crowd of competitors. The objective is to make a message memorable and able to tell something unique about a product by emphasizing its distinctive traits. Since the message must be memorable, it must be straightforward and compact, typically condensed in one short sentence.

Positioning messages are built using the ‘emphasize’ strategy in three steps, (1) select the trait or feature you want
to magnify; (2) bend secondary traits or features to serve the key message; (3) obscure or put everything else on the background.

When applied to product design, emphasizing can go beyond ergonomic and functional considerations. By aligning users’ expectations and mental models to prominent features addressing those expectations, emphasis achieves instructional and communicational value that makes products intuitive and useful.

Whether validated by evolution or by relevant expertise and rational assessment, emphasizing can help form a sound judgment and communicate effectively.

[…] psychological theory, known as the instrument’s law, can help us show why emphasis can be a curse and a blessing. The law is often summarized with the sentence ‘for a kid with a hammer, the whole world is a nail’ (Maslow 1966). By design, an instrument constrains action to a limited set of possibilities because it concentrates attention and energy on where it needs to be. For instance, a hammer channels our strength towards the point where this energy can provide the highest impact.

If a tool constrains our actions, it does so for our thinking.

In order to differentiate you need to know what ‘average’ means in your case. You need to know your point of departure . . . Before you depart. Beware the consequences: Consistency is everything when you look for emphasis; make sure you understand the implications of going more extreme. Form follows function: This is particularly true when emphasizing. Again, you need have a solid reason to justify exaggeration. Think visually: Metaphors tend to come easily to mind if embedded into real or symbolic imagery. It is not by chance that the words image and imagination have the same root. Translate: When you use a metaphor, you are entering a different linguistic world in which your design needs to reflect a different vocabulary. Take it to the limit: Do not be shy with your metaphors, take them to the extreme. It might turn out to be a silly game, but what if it leads you to an eureka moment?

                                                                                                    

Strategy III.  Remix
This strategy is about the disassembling and reconnecting of elements into new combinations to deliver novel meaning […]

[…] remixing always happens in the presence of a strong shared narrative and in the absence of complete information.

the remix strategy requires four components: (1) parts to recombine (e.g. ideas or physical components); (2) “liquid” work environment favouring smooth but partially constrained movement of parts as opposed to purely random movement; (3) surplus (e.g. wealth, time and/or energy to support movement and recombination); (4) narrative polarization, orienting change towards one direction as pointed out by shared storytelling about what is fair and desirable, even against established rules.

The creation of aesthetically viable forms is intrinsically a remix operation. We experience this often in our everyday life, when, for instance, we try to match clothes or choose furniture for our house. We learn that colour and pattern matching have their own rules. Sometimes, we dare a more unusual combination and are surprised by its effect. Artists typically set out to recombine materials, shapes, and techniques through endless experimentation to identify novel aesthetic configurations that turn out to be extremely useful in conveying their intent or message.

Deliberate rule violation is necessary for recombination because remixing is always an attempt to obtain degrees of freedom.

In fiction and poetry, a common method for remixing is metaphor. A metaphor is a linguistic device through which an unfamiliar concept is referred to in terms of another that is assumed to better convey or exalt one or more features of the original, typically in a visual way.

Design can activate good or bad memories. What we memorize is a collection of events and objects that can be arranged in many different ways; our memories are actively reconstructed every time and driven by intention. Good memories can be analyzed to find inspiration; bad memories to identify pain points. Just do it! When you do not know what to do, just act. Action can come in many forms: Read, observe, talk, watch, visit, exercise. If your mind is open, anything can be a source of inspiration. If it is closed, then break out! Tinker, again: Assembling, disassembling, stressing, re-organizing are all ways to play with your design and escape paralysis without being oppressed by the anxiety of finishing. Tinkering should be playful and free. Question the taken-for-granted: List all things you would like to do but you can’t and the reasons, then work on the list to find out which ‘nos’ are real impossibilities. Bricolage: When the block is due to unavailability of certain expensive resources, look outside of your field to find out what others did to solve similar problems. You’ll be surprised! Innovation garage: Look around, ask around and use what you have to build a low fidelity prototype. It doesn’t matter how weird it looks.

                                                                                                    

Strategy IV.  Contrast and Balance
This strategy works by juxtaposing elements that are supposed to be in some relationship using colour, shapes, or composition.

At the core of this strategy there is the creation of differences in potential in terms of energy or information, with the aim of moving the configuration of a system in a desired direction. When it comes to design, contrast and balance is about creating informational tensions by redistributing information and users’ attention towards the creation of a pleasurable but dynamic equilibrium. 

“The successful player understands the system of tensions that is in place, the factors that determine the equilibrium and those that can be leveraged to break it.” Interesting note for chessologics.

When it comes to design, contrast and balance works in a similar fashion by creating tensions that will induce users to break the status quo to achieve a pleasurable and advantageous equilibrium.

Artists use contrasting and balancing for two reasons: 1) to isolate salient elements; 2) to connect these elements in a web of tension. We can think of this web as a conversation in which elements talk to each other in a dialogic tension.

The conversation then evolves either towards the confusion generated by many speakers talking at the same time or comes to a halt because nobody knows what to say.

[…] the sense of disorientation that we might have felt in front of a visual representation that we are not able to make sense of […] By resorting to variety of ordering devices, including linguistic and visual tools, whose aim is to frame unstructured experience into a meaningful web of connections.

There are at least two opposite ways in which such connections can be made meaningful: (a) to express equilibrium and unity; (b) to suggest imminent disintegration. Both these intents suggest the potential for action, to anticipate that something interesting has happened or is going to happen.

A less dramatic application of contrast and balance is in the design choices of innovative products. […] The introduction of something radically new requires balancing the novelty of the idea with some familiar elements that help users make sense and not be scared.

“Effective complex solutions are the creations of individuals endowed with an effectively complex personality.”

Escape flatland: A hilly landscape is generally preferred to a flat one. So, think of your design as a landscape. How flat does it look? Where do you need to concentrate information and why? Contrast for action: Inspect your design and look for anything that solicits questions and actions. If you can’t find anything, consider adding contrast. Checks and balance: Think of your design as a graphic composition. Each part should have a counterpart that confers balance to the whole. Graphic contrast should always be associated with some sort of aim or message that is intelligible to users. Make sure the message is there and that the users can read it.  Play the opposite game: Try to define your design in terms of what it is not or what it does not do. Make a list and check if everything you have there is intended. Are there things that you would like your design to be or to do? Congratulations, you have a design trade-off you can play with. From ‘either or’ to ‘and’: Transform opposites into a two-dimensional space. For instance, transform the contradiction classic-modern into a diagram in which these dimensions are orthogonal and then place your design and its competitors in there. See which one better conjugates the two opposites.

                                                                                                    

Design as Aesthetic Intelligence. 
[…] there is a deep relationship between aesthetics and complexity. An aesthetically attractive design is not just there to appease our senses but also to facilitate sense-making by guiding our perception and increasing our ability to absorb new information.
Knowledge as experience of complexity.
Any design should incorporate emotional and functional elements and ensure that these two levels are appropriately connected and do not stand in each other’s way.
